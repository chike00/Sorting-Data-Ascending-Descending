# Sorting-Data-Ascending-Descending
Sorts data in multiple columns in either ascending or descending manner
===============
Javascript Sort
===============

Using HTML and Angular (+Javascript), I took an array of objects with some test data (which will eventually be read from a database), and
put them in a table format using ng-repeat, you can then decide on the table in what order this data needs to be sorted in, 
ascended or descending order.
